# CS120-FinalProject

====
EDIT
====
The goal of the project was to create a working game with two game states, one where the player made descisions, changing different values (support, awareness, survivors, and casualties) and gaining movement points, which would then be used in the different game state. This other state would consist of directing a sprite to different "locations", again resulting in the different game values. The game would continue until the player either saved the geese, or failed.

technologies & techniques
I utilized Inkscape to design the graphics as well as quickly determining the correct positions of different labels/buttons.
The largest difficulty I faced was the time constraint and being to ambitious in my goals. Not only did I design a complicated game that would be difficult to create in such a short amount of time, I was not prepared for some of the random errors I had to troubleshoot. The largest of which was the inability to render certain colors of brown, which took days out of my limited work time. I discovered this by eventually changing the colors of my images, finding that some rendered perfectly, while others were either distorted or missing large sections. 


- Difficulties:
	- setting the active document sprite, so buttons only activate one sprite at a time



All visual assets created by me.
